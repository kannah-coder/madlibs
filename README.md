# Mad Libs Story Generator  

A simple Python project that creates funny stories based on your inputs.  

## How it works  
1. The program reads a template from **`story.txt`** (with placeholders like `[adjective]`, `[noun]`, `[verb]`, etc.).  
2. It asks you to enter words for each placeholder.  
3. It replaces them in the story and prints the final version.  

## Files  
- `madlibs.py` → main Python script  
- `story.txt` → story template with placeholders
